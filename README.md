Boilerplate with focus on best practices and painless developer experience:

- Minimal setup that can be extended
- Nodejs based express server
- TypeScript first
- RESTful APIs
- JWT authentication

## Requirements

- [Node v16+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## > Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install a Postgresql database.

> If you work with a docker, install postgres as a docker container and expose it to your dev environment.

```
docker run -it name postgresql -e POSTGRES_USER=<username> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -e POSTGRES_DB=<db name> -v <folder path on computer>:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

### Step 2: Clone this Project

Clone this repo with git.

```
git clone <repo link>
```

In `.env` file you have to add your postgres database connection information that was entered while creating docker container.

### Step 3: Setup your Application Environment.

```bash
npm install
```

> This installs all dependencies. 

```bash
npm run migration:run
```
> This migrates the database by creating the table schema. 

So after this your application environment is ready to use.

### Step 4: Serve your App

Go to the project dir and start your app with this yarn script.

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the server according to these changes.
> The server will start running on port `4000`.

## Running ðŸ’¥

Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) or if using Postman grab [config](/postman).

## Features:

- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) framework
- [TypeScript v4](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) codebase
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) using Data Mapper pattern
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment:
  - Easily start local development using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with single command `npm run docker:dev`
  - Connect to different staging or production environments `npm run docker:[stage|prod]`
  - Ready for **microservices** development and deployment.  
    Once API changes are made, just build and push new docker image with your favourite CI/CD tool  
    `docker build -t <username>/api-boilerplate:latest .`  
    `docker push <username>/api-boilerplate:latest`
  - Run unit, integration (or setup with your frontend E2E) tests as `docker exec -ti be_boilerplate_test sh` and `npm run test`
- Contract first REST API design:
  - never break API again with HTTP responses and requests payloads using [type definitions](./src/types/express/index.d.ts)
  - Consistent schema error [response](./src/utils/response/custom-error/types.ts). Your frontend will always know how to handle errors thrown in `try...catch` statements ðŸ’ª
- JWT authentication and role based authorization using custom middleware
- Set local, stage or production [environmental variables](./config) with [type definitions](./src/types/ProcessEnv.d.ts)
- Logging with [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)
- Unit and integration tests with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter
- Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- Automated npm & Docker dependency updates with [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) (set to patch version only)
- Commit messages must meet [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.  
  After staging changes just run `npm run commit` and get instant feedback on your commit message formatting and be prompted for required fields by [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
